# prs-demo
This is the demo to be used on demo day.
Usage: Pull, generate database (add-migration/update-database), run backend in visual studio, run npm install, run ng serve -o. Please try and avoid changing the backend (PRSv1.0.0) and focus updating the angular code (prs-ng). If you have any questons feel free to slack me.
